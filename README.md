# SWAN
Shifted Weighted Annotation Network

To install, direct RStudio to install a package from the swan_x.x.x.tar.gz file.

You must download large files containing genome annotations separately and place these unzipped files in your R "swan" package folder.

These are "mm10.zip" and "hg38.zip", and must be transferred to the ".../swan/inst/extdata/Annotations/" folder. The unzipped paths should be:
".../swan/inst/extdata/Annotations/mm10/" and
".../swan/inst/extdata/Annotations/hg38/"
